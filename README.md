# Salary-Prediction
Applying Regression and Regression Tree Analysis to Predict Salary

This project uses the "Glassdoor Analyze Gender Paygap" dataset available at the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nilimajauhari/glassdoor-analyze-gender-pay-gap?resource=download

I have originally completed an analysis on this dataset using stepwise linear regression and regression tree analysis for the course MBA 642 (Business Analytics).

In this analysis, I will automate the process using a variety of libraries in python to create a linear regression model and a regression tree model, in order to predict salary based on the selected features. I will then compare the models using the R2 score.

The features of the data set are:

Job Title
<br />Gender
<br />Age
<br />PerfEval
<br />Education
<br />Dept
<br />Seniority
<br />Base Pay
<br />Bonus
